# Cybersecurity Awareness Content

## Overview:
A training video was created to highlight AWS S3 bucket security, drawing lessons from the SEGA Europe data breach.


## Key Points:
- Risk Highlight: SEGA's S3 bucket misconfiguration incident exemplifies a common risk of leaks.
- Incident Impact: API keys, messaging systems, and user data was exposed. 
- Best Practices: Shared insights on securing AWS S3 buckets and promoting responsible disclosure.


## Objectives:
- To raise awareness on AWS S3 security risks.
- Highlight the real-world impact using SEGA's case study.
- Encourage best practices and responsible disclosure.

# Project Walk-Through

## Step 1: Identifying the Opportunity
Leveraging real-world events like the SEGA data breach ([read more](https://threatpost.com/sega-security-aws-s3-exposed-steam/177352/)), this training highlights cybersecurity risks and best practices through the lens of threat modeling and current news.

After considering the security implications of this event, I targeted individuals in our organization who use cloud storage, particularly AWS, to ensure they were informed and prepared.

## Step 2: Developing the Outline
To effectively educate these users, a training outline was created addressing the following:

- Understanding the risks associated with AWS S3 buckets.
- Identifying and mitigating the risks of insecure S3 buckets.
- Implementing best practices for securing S3 buckets.

## Step 3: Creating the Video
A short video addressing the risks associated with AWS S3 Buckets was created:

## Step 5: Repeating the Process 
Steps 1-4 can be repeated to create similar cybersecurity awareness content, ideally once a week.
